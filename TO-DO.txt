There should be an option to concatenate commands with pipes.
• Each of the commands created should work on their own, they should be independent
programs.
• The users should have the option to list the last movements done (last commands used).
• All possible error should be handled and users should be informed about the reason of the
error. For example:
▪ $ ls añsldk
ls: cannot access añsldk: No such file or directory
• Every command should have a man page with its specification.
