This is the physical apeareance.
Hi, im MIllan, a 50 year old man with glasses, and i like to wear earrings.

This is the moral.
Im a really relaxed guy, who likes to work and make people laugh.

This is the Identity.
I have insomnia, thats why some strangers are scared of me, but im a pacifist and would never do anything bad to anyone.

This is the relationship with the dead body.
I wasnt close to him, but I knew him because we went to the same college.

This is the accusation.
Im not sure who the assasin is, but Alex looks like he is hiding something.
