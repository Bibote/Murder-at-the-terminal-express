Hi! I am 17 years old mate and, as you can see, I have long hair and I'am kinda tall and heavy.
Some months ago I was diagnosed with anxiety. I know what you might be thinking... "This youth of today are made of glass" but actually is a very serious issue that I'm dealing with. This is the reason why when you try to speak with me, sometimes I refuse, this whole situation is beyond me.
I prefer to be alone and i dont like when people get close to me without asking for permission and I like to spend time in the corridor watching people walk from side to side.
I dont really know him, I just saw him talking with Ahmed at the corridor, but Marc didnt seem to care what Ahmed was telling him.
I don't really suspect of no one, but if I had to say a name, I would say Edurne. She looked stressed and sad the times I saw her walk through the corridor.
