This is the physical apeareance.
Hu, im Ahmed, a 43 year old man with glasses, and im pretty tall and fit.

This is the moral.
Im pretty sad for what happened to Marc, and i would like to help find the killer.

This is the Identity.
Im a cool guy to be around, but I dont like people wasting my time.

This is the relationship with the dead body.
He is a friend of mine, but I didnt like what he was pulling off while being with Edurne.

This is the accusation.
I think Wiame did it, im not sure why but he spent most of the trip looking at Marc in a pretty obsesive way.
