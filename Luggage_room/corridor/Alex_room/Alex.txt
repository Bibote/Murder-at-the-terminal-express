This is the physical apeareance.
Hi! I am 17 years old mate and, as you can see, I have long hair and I'am kinda tall and heavy.

This is the moral.
Some months ago I was diagnosed with anxiety. I know what you might be thinking... "This youth of today are made of glass" but actually is a very serious issue that I'm dealing with. This is the reason why when you try to speak with me, sometimes I refuse, this whole situation is beyond me.

This is the identity


This is the relationship with the victim
I met him in a train 

This is the accusation.
I don't really suspect of no one, but if I had to say a name, I would say Edurne. She looked stressed when i crossed paths with her in the corridor
